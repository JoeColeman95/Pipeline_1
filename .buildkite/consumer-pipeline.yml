# Consumer pipeline that uses anchors from base-anchors.yml
# The anchor is defined in base-anchors.yml and referenced here

steps:
  # First, say hello world
  - label: "Consumer Hello World"
    command: |
      echo "Hello from the consumer pipeline!"
      echo "About to use the shared anchor..."

  # Now use the imported anchor
  - <<: *hello_world_step
    key: "reused-hello-world"
    label: "🌍 Hello World (Reused Anchor)"

  # Additional step to prove concept
  - label: "POC: Anchor Reuse Success"
    depends_on: "reused-hello-world"
    command: |
      echo "✅ Proof of Concept Complete!"
      echo "Successfully reused the hello_world_step anchor"
      echo "This demonstrates YAML anchor sharing between pipelines"
